# Project Report: [Your Project Title]

## 1. Overview
Briefly describe the purpose, target domain, and core functionality of your application or AI agent.

## 2. Design and Implementation

### 2.1 Architecture
Explain the high-level architecture (e.g., client-server, agent workflow, tool orchestration). Include a diagram if helpful (can be ASCII or referenced image).

### 2.2 Integrated APIs / Services / LLMs
List and describe each external component used. For each, include:
- Name and provider
- Purpose in your system
- API/Service type (REST, GraphQL, MCP, etc.)
- Authentication method (API key, OAuth, mock, etc.)

> **Total integrated sources**: â‰¥4 (as per constraint)

### 2.3 Data Fusion or Collaboration Strategy
Explain how data from multiple sources is combined, or how multiple LLMs/tools collaborate to produce a coherent output.

### 2.4 Local Knowledge & External Tool Usage (if applicable)
If your system uses a local knowledge base (e.g., vector store, document corpus) alongside live tool calls, describe:
- How local knowledge is stored and retrieved
- When and why external tools are triggered
- How responses are synthesized

## 3. Technologies Used

| Component Type       | Name / Framework / SDK                     | Official Documentation Link |
|----------------------|--------------------------------------------|------------------------------|

| External API #1      | e.g., OpenWeatherMap REST API              | [link]                       |
| External API #2      | e.g., Google Places API                    | [link]                       |
| External API #3      | e.g., TMDb API                             | [link]                       |
| External API #4      | e.g., NewsAPI                              | [link]                       |
| Local LLM (if any)   | e.g., Ollama + Llama 3                     | [link]                       |
| Deployment Platform  | e.g., Streamlit, FastAPI + Render          | [link]                       |

## 4. Use of GenAI Tools

List any generative AI tools used during development (e.g., for code generation, prompt design, debugging):

- **Tool Name**: e.g., GitHub Copilot  
  **Usage**: Assisted in writing API wrapper functions and error handling logic.

- **Tool Name**: e.g., Claude 3.5 Sonnet  
  **Usage**: Generated initial system prompts for agent roles and refined user query parsing logic.

> *Note: All AI-generated code was reviewed, tested, and modified for correctness and stability.*

## 5. Configuration & Deployment

### 5.1 Setup Instructions
- Clone repository
- Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- Set environment variables (`.env` example provided)
- Run: `python app.py`

### 5.2 Deployment
- Deployed via [e.g., Streamlit Cloud / Vercel / Render]
- Public demo URL: [link] (if available)

## 6. Challenges & Lessons Learned
Briefly discuss technical hurdles (e.g., API rate limits, inconsistent data formats, agent hallucination) and how you addressed them.

## 7. Conclusion
Summarize the achievement, limitations, and potential future enhancements.
